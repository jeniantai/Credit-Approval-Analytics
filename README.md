## Credit Approval Analytics


### Problem
Some banks still have most of their loan decisions made by combining external credit score data (e.g. FICO score) with rules that their analysts create manually (primarily by writing SQL queries). This exercise is to help a bank to make use of their internal data and machine learning power in order to improve precision and efficiency of the loan approval process. 

### Approach
1. Data Understanding
- Thorough analysis of the relationships between the target and the various features and also the relationships between the important features.
2. Prediction / Classification
- Logistic Regression
- XGBosst
- Random Forest

### Result
Compare AUC of three models, suggest further refinement for the models.
Then, build a presentation of explaining the relationship, tradeoffs and results in a client/user-friendly fashion
